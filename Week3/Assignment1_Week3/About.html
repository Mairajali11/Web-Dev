This media group publishes a number of newspapers and magazines in Urdu and English. IMC also owns the Geo TV network.</p>
            <h4>Early life and education</h4>
                <p>Mir Shakil ur Rahman was born on 8 January 1957 in Karachi, to father Mir Khalil ur Rahman and mother Mehmooda Khalil ur Rahman. He is of Kashmiri descent, as his paternal grandparents had immigrated from Kashmir Valley. He grew up with six siblings; an older brother, four older sisters and a younger sister.

            <h4>Career</h4>
            <p>In the late 1990s, during Nawaz Sharif's second term as prime minister, Shakil was first asked by Sharif's government to dismiss some of the staff members of the Jang Group. Keeping in line with the tradition of the media group that was founded by Mir Shakil's father, Mir Khalil ur Rehman, Shakil refused to dismiss the staff, a number of tax evasion cases were filed against his news group amounting to 40 million US dollars, followed by freezing of bank accounts and seizure of their assets. The government withdrew their court cases after some facts were made public by Shakil. Shakil founded Geo TV in May 2002. Shakil established a television channel network by the name of Geo TV in May 2002. He was arrested by the NAB on 12 March 2020 on the allegations of getting 52 kanal land in Lahore by that time Chief Minister of Punjab Nawaz Sharif.</p>
